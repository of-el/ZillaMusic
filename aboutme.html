				<h1>About myself</h1>
				<p class="rounded-red">
					I am a 24 year old music producer turned software 
					engineer. I was born and raised in the Central Valley,
					more specifically Livingston, Ca. I was a normal
					kid growing up. Did well in school and tried
					staying busy with after school activities such
					as sports and in high school I joined the 
					marching band and drumline. I attended UC Davis for
					a year, but left to try and figure out what it is 
					I really wanted to do with my future. I spent a 
					year at community college to get lower division
					courses out of the way, and in that time I really
					dove into producing music. I fell in love with it. I was
					once again able to work with music. In high school
					I had started a band of my own, but we split up 
					going our separate ways. Music production on my
					laptop allowed me to stay in touch with my passion.
					After taking a couple music production courses at
					Cogswell, I realized that music was just my hobby,
					and I didn't want to mix business with pleasure. At
					the same time, my curiosity for understanding how things worked, led me to software development. I 
					wanted to learn how the tools I used for music 
					production on my laptop were created. At first it was
					all a mystery, but my time at Cogswell studying 
					software has enriched my knowledge.
